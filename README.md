# odin-flexbox-project

This is a landing page modeled after the example from TOP. I could replace most stuff with my own ideas, but I honestly rather just confirm that I got the flexbox fundamentals to a T and move on to the next challenge, because there's much more to come. Later I can go back to these concepts and just improve.
